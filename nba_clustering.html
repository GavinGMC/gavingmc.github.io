        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>The intention I have for this experiment is to group NBA players based on their stats. Grouping players by stats can provide very valuable insights on the game. There is a debate throughout sports on statistics vs the "eye test" which is basically traits that don't show up on a stat sheet. I want to generalize players impacts on the floor using the major basketball stats including points, assists, rebounds, and shooting percentage.</p>
